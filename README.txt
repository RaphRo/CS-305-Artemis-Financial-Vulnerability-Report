# CS-305-Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Report
# Student: Raphael Rose

For this assignment we were asked to look at Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial is a financial advisor and wealth management company interested in providing savings guidance to their 
customers. The company is interested in getting their web aplication secure for their customers. That security specifically is around setting up an HTTPS capable application that 
supports cryptographic hash functions. The application has been abstracted, assumedbly to black box the project consultants from the intellectual property of the comapny. 

I think for this assignment I excelled at understanding and interpretting the vulnerabilities described in the static vulnerability report. I spent time researching the vulnerabilities 
and understanding how they impacted my code. I will say becuase the project was an abstraction with little actual code to review it made it difficult to parse what dependencies were 
impactful and which were not. Nonetheless, secure coding is an important practice because it helps protect you, your customers, your organization, and your hardware. The value of 
software security is in the ability to mitigate risk. If the company is in the business of trading in secure data or personal information then this value is extremely high because their 
product is in essence trust. I think my greatest challenge working through the vulnerability assessment was knowing when to apply my fixes and when to subdue the vulnerability. 

I approached the increased security layer assignment per the instructions provided. I first increased the security of the web application and then implemented the cipher finally I 
processed the vulnerability report and looked for ways to resolve the identified vulnerabilities. As far as the functional review I implemented the application, tested and ran it. I 
reviewed the code and identified and documented areas of known risk. 

I frequently installed, ran, cleaned and virified my code as part of this assignment. I processed and reprocessed at each step to ensure that the code was running and no new 
vulnerabilities were introduced. Further I tested and verified after each step in the process. Finally I used double validate my certificates and went through the process multiple times 
to make sure it was well understood. 

I think I would like to showcase the HTTPS connection that is self hosted. I would probably clean this up to ensure no errors in the browser but this feels like a powerful skill to have 
when setting up web aplications. This is actually a topic I'm extremely ernthusiastic about learning more about. I have been working on my linux and my git hub integration to better 
establish the architectural skills for bring code to life.
